<h1>The Camp Experience</h1>
<p>The past two summers I have worked at a local camp in Raleigh. My favorite thing about my experience as a camp counselor is the opportunity to mentor and impact the lives of younger children. I aspire to be a positive role model for all my campers, but my favorite age group is the 5-7-year-old day campers. Our camp activities include swimming, gym games, crafts, and outdoor sport activities like ropes courses and mini golf. There are primarily three main jobs for staff each summer: day camp counselor, overnight counselor, and program staff (they set up activities and keep things running smoothly around camp). I enjoy working with people that are close to my age and that have similar goals as me. While the food is not the best, and sometimes it is hard to get a good nightâ€™s sleep, the opportunity to serve others and have fun outweighs any negatives. <br>
